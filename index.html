    <p>
      It's only been two months but it already feels like a lifetime spent with you showered in love and affection. 
      You came to me at a time in my life where everything was falling apart and I was losing myself to the darkness.
      You walked through the blades around my heart and fought your way through and to me that is the manliest,
      bravest and most loving thing anyone could do to me. My love for you will remain strong and bright just like 
      the light you keep my soul in with your presence. <br/> <br/> <b>

          Happy two months my darling, my knight, and my husband.
